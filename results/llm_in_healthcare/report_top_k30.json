As healthcare systems increasingly rely on vast amounts of unstructured data, the ability of LLMs to comprehend and generate human-like text presents significant opportunities for enhancing clinical workflows, improving patient outcomes, and facilitating research. The potential for LLMs to streamline tasks such as clinical documentation, referral management, and patient communication underscores the importance of understanding their capabilities and limitations within this critical domain (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019).\n\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the application of LLMs in healthcare, focusing on key methodologies and their implications for real-world applications. We will examine hybrid models that combine LLMs with domain-specific rules for improved entity recognition in healthcare documents, such as the proposed LayoutLMv3 framework, as well as innovations like StructuralLM, which enhances form understanding through structural pre-training. By synthesizing findings from various studies, this survey seeks to elucidate the current landscape of LLM applications in healthcare and identify future research directions that could further optimize their utility in clinical settings (W4387074849; W3173325518).",
